# GitBash and GitHub README

This repo covers the following concepts/tools:
- Bash
- Git Bash
- Git Hub
- Issues and Troubleshooting

## Bash
Bash is a command line/shell language used in Linux terminals. It is also compatible with macOS (however Apple has replaced it with zsh as a default shell). Window's shell language is powershell.

_Note: macOS and linux distros share some similar functionality due to fact that the kernels/codebases have some similarities in structure. For a time macOS used bash and it worth noting that zsh, even as Apple attempts to move away from bash, is still similar to bash._
 
We can use it to create files, navigate our computer or run programs.

#### Basic Bash Commands
- ls : lists current directory
- rm : removes a file/directory
- .. : navigates back a folder
- cd : changes directory
- mkdir :creates new directory
- atom . :opens atom editor in folder
- code : opens vs code editor in folder
- -a : shows hidden files/folders


## Git
Git is a powerful version control used by developers globally and is commonplace in industry.
It can go backwards in time and forwards.
It can also create separate branches (or universes) to allow us to experiment.

#### Basic GitBash Commands
- git init : Used to intialise a repo on the local machine. You should be in the directory to run this one.

- git status : This shows the tracked files on the machine and the status of the files IE. tracked, staged or committed.
 
- git log : Shows the commit history, master branches, and origin.

- git checkout master: Git checkout's from the master branch and this allows the user to switch between previous commit histories and branches

- git checkout 'commit hash, branch': Similar to checkout master, git checkout allows the local user to switch to a different commit, branch or back to the master head.

- git remote -- v : This show the remote urls connected to the master for both fetch and push purposes.
  
- git diff: will show the differences made that are yet to be staged or committed.

- git add '': stages the file changes. Use '.' to stage all changes within the directory.

- git commit -m 'Meaningful message': commits all staged changes to git master. It is good practice to leave conscise, clear message of the committed changes so when the history is checked users know what the commit was for.

- git push origin master: pushes to origin master and is needed for first time pushes to remote repos. Once credentials have been established we can declare the shorter "git push".

##Git Hub
GitHub is remote origin to git and is a website where developers can publish and share code.

https://github.com/

Remote origin repos can be made by going to your account and adding a new repo once you have created the repo GitHub will give instructions as how to add the remote origin as an upstream remote to your local git master branch. 

#### ssh keys vs login
There are two main ways of authentication for pushing to remote repos and adding collaborators to git repos. When pushing to remote repo's you may use either an ssh key once or add you remote credentials every time (when prompted). SSH keys can also be distributed to collaborators who branch of the project master and merge the master files. Alternatively you can add collaborators via GitHub.com in the repo's options. 

#### Pushing
where the local repo pushes up to the github repo.

- git push 
- git push 'location'

#### Pulling
Where the github repo pulls from the local repo.

#### Cloning
Cloning is the way to copy a repo to your local folders you are go to start by going to the repo on github.com and hitting the clone button on the top right of the repo page then go to the terminal and accessing the directory you want to make your copy and run the git clone command with the copied repo https or ssh key.

command:
- git clone 'repo'

#### Branching
Branching is used to allow collaborators to create seperate branches where developments can take place without conflicting with the master branch. This is useful as it means that the master branch can always contain working code that can still be in production whilst alterations (that break code) can be made seperately and then merged later when code is fully function. It helpful to think of the master branch as a Production environment and the branches as UAT environments.

##### Commands needed to create branch and add changes:

- git checkout remote -b 'name of branch'

_Note: when checking out of master into branch git will bring any pending stages and commits._

- git add and git commit
- git push origin 'branch name'

#### Merging
Go to branched repo on github.com after committing a recent branch. Select the pull and merge request in project files, then fill out the commit messages and hit merge. This will merge new feature of the branch to the master branch so everyone can use it.

#### Forking
This is a github action that copies the whole repo to your account. Normally forking will happen on github with the button located on the webpage of the repo you want to fork.
